Code Repo for ROB 530 Final Project - Group 1. 

In this work, we present iLoco, a real-time, plug-and-play visual SLAM system that leverages the iPhone’s built-in RGB-D camera and IMU to enable accurate localization. By integrating a sensor suite from the iPhone, iLoco delivers robust pose estimation by utilizing ORB feature matching for RGB-D visual feature extraction and tracking, while GTSAM is employed to tightly integrate inertial measurements with visual odometry for enhanced robustness and accuracy. The system is engineered to be a “slap on” solution, requiring minimal setup and no external calibration, making it especially suitable for rapid prototyping, educational demonstrations, and accessible SLAM research. iLoco’s design prioritizes ease of use and adaptability, enabling a wide range of users—from students to developers—to harness the power of real-time SLAM using everyday mobile devices.
